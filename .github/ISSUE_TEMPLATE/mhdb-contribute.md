Hello! Welcome to MHDB Contribute.

To submit your .tdb file you will need to compress it to a .zip file that can be attached to this message*. If you have multiple tdb files, you can submit all of them at once in the same .zip file.

Once you have your .zip file attached to this message, fill out the information below for your tdb. If you are uploading multiple files, copy and paste the tags below at the beginning of each .tdb in your .zip file.
```
$ DATABASE_TITLE:
$ DATABASE_AUTHOR:
$ DATABASE_YEAR:
$ DATABASE_DOI:
```
After completing the previous steps, click on the green `Submit new issue` button below. As soon as you do it, your tdb file(s) will be processed and added to the MHDB-community database.

**Hang tight, the confirmation of your contributions will be posted on this channel. In a couple of minutes, your data, along with the reference to your work, will be added to our database and will be available for you and other fellow researchers using MHDB.**

We thank you for your contribution and hope this tool may be of great significance for your work!

*PS: GitHub attaches files as links, which can be created using the 'clip' symbol above or by 'drag-and-drop' your file to this message. Please replace this example with your ZIP file link: [Example](URL)
