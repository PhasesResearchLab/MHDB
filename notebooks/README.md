# MHDB Notebooks

## Quick Start

Thank you for your interest in MHDB. 

This is a Quick Start guide to get you up and running with MHDB's dataset and calculations. If you are running this notebook through pre-configured Codespaces, you are ready to go as several steps have already been completed for you. If you picked it up from GitHub on your own, make sure you have Python installed on your local machine, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and install the necessary dependencies using pip by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

To start, open the [**`TdH2.ipynb`**](TdH2.ipynb) notebook inside this directory and follow the instructions there. **Please note, once prompted to select a kernel (after running the first code cell), you should select the `base` kernel (which should show up as recommended).**
